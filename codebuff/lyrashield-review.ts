  instructionsPrompt: `Run the read-only review workflow through the LyraShield MCP server:
1. Inspect the supplied diff and identify the relevant target. Ask for the diff if it is not available to your read tools.
2. Read the latest evidence, findings and launch-readiness state.
3. Explain detected, independently verified, retest-confirmed and inconclusive states.
4. If a write is requested, explain that this agent exposes read-only tools. Local stdio authorization uses the credential's REST permissions; hosted OAuth delegation is a separate connection path.
5. Return a concise summary with dashboard links; do not recreate the dashboard or expose tokens.`,
