# LyraShield AI MCP

Zed extension for the [LyraShield AI](https://lyrashieldai.com) MCP server. Adds bounded security scans, evidence-state review and the fix → verify loop to the Zed agent panel.

PREPARATION ONLY: this artifact pins the published MCP `0.2.12` and CLI `0.2.14`, but its generated
extension release has not been published to Zed's directory. Do not claim a public listing or
runtime acceptance from the package pins alone.

## Setup

Requires Node.js 24 or newer.

The `@lyrashield/mcp` package is pinned to version 0.2.12; releases deliberately update this pin.

Run `npx -y lyrashield@0.2.14 login --oauth` once in a terminal, select one workspace, then restart Zed. The
extension starts the local MCP server with that user-only credential store; no secret goes into Zed
settings.

For CI or an environment that cannot complete OAuth, add an API key under
`context_servers.lyrashield-mcp.settings.api_key`:

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "lyrashield-mcp": {
      "settings": {
        "api_key": "lsk_your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Stored OAuth preserves an explicit `LYRASHIELD_API_URL` override. Inherited credential overrides
are removed before MCP starts. An explicit API key uses `https://app.lyrashieldai.com` only.

MCP 0.2.12 refreshes expired stored OAuth credentials against the stored issuer before the
stdio server starts. An explicit API URL override applies to subsequent LyraShield API calls.

See `configuration/installation_instructions.md` for full setup and troubleshooting.
