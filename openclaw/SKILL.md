# LyraShield AI review skill

Use the LyraShield MCP connection to inspect release-assurance evidence, summarize current
issues, and explain pending approvals. Prefer read-only tools. Do not claim that a result is a
security guarantee or that all Vibe Security 50 controls were verified.

The skill is a community ClawHub listing. It is not an official OpenClaw channel. Link to
LyraShield dashboard evidence instead of
recreating dashboard UI or copying report contents into prompts.

Write actions require OAuth `lyrashield.write`. New delegated connections authorize
their workflows once through the Connect consent and then execute within connection
permissions using an idempotency key; legacy nondelegated credentials keep the
exact-argument approval gate.

Use `lyrashield_check_diff` to review changes and `lyrashield_verify_fix` to retest findings.
Fixes are proposals. Authorized workflows execute within connection permissions; pull requests never auto-merge.
